# Awful-sudoku
A really bad sudoku solver

I'm not good at sudoku or writing clean code off the bat so I came up with an idea to try and solve a sudko in a single function, via a human - style method with the worst style. No edits. It turned out horrible. But for this one test case it surprisingly works and doesn't violate flake8 style.
